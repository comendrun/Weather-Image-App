## Overview

### The Project

Users should be able to:

This is a ReactJs app that I made using two different APIs. both APIs get the input from the user and search for the proper response for it in the backend.
one API is for weather information by the OpenWeatherMap website and the other one is for the Unsplash website to get a related Image from Unsplash servers with the entered input from the user.
I used the backend (NodeJS, ExpressJS) to hide my API keys from any visitor. it was a fun way of hiding API keys because for a long time I just wondered if it is possible to hide this kind of information from the sight of visitors and thanks to this [toturial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwfjMebjTU) from Ania Kub√≥w I was able to do it.
